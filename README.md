## 1. Introduction
The `mTower` is a new Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) specially designed
to protect size-constrained IoT devices based on Cortex-m23 MCU. Usage mTower
pre-embedded into the microcontroller, a module developer can use a simple SDK
that based on Global Platform API standards to add security to their solution.

## 2. License
mTower software consists of multiple components that are individually available
under different licensing terms. Terms for each individual file are listed at
the beginnings of corresponding files; also, all licenses are listed in
[COPYING] file.

## 3. Platforms supported

Several platforms are supported. In order to manage slight differences
between platforms, a `PLATFORM` flag has been introduced.

| Platform                  | Composite PLATFORM flag            | Maintained |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|------------|
| [NuMaker-PFM-M2351]       |`PLATFORM=numaker_pfm_m2351`        | v0.4       |
| [M2351-Badge]             |`PLATFORM=m2351_badge`              | v0.4       |
| [V2M-MPS2-Qemu]           |`PLATFORM=mps2_an505_qemu`          | v0.4       |
| [SparkFun RED-V RedBoard] |`PLATFORM=sparkfun_redboard`        | v0.5       |

For information on adding a new platform see the [how to add a platform].

## 4. Get and build mTower software
Please see [build] for instructions how to run mTower on various devices.

---
## 5. Source code structure
The general [source code structure] for mTower is similar to the structure of the
multy platforms source code.

---
## 6. Coding standards
In this project we are trying to adhere to the mTower coding convention 
(see [CodingStyle]). However there are a few exceptions that we had to make since
the code also uses other open source components.

---
## 7. Documentation
There is a brief overall [functionality description](docs/mtower_functionality_description.md) of mTower. Other mTower documentation for the project is located in the [docs] folder. The latest version of the specification that describes the mTower source code can be generated using [doxygen] tool from command line. To generate documentation, use

```sh
make docs_gen
```
command, and to view generated docs use

```sh
make docs_show
```
> Note that documentation on mTower is work in progress, and right now doxygen does not provide much documentation.

---
## 8. Contributing
If you want to contribute to the mTower project and make it better, your help is
very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social
coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems. [How to contribute
you can find here](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
